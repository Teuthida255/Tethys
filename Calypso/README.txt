Calypso is an interactive Sega Saturn music program designed to test the core concepts of the Tethys sound engine. Although it is still a work in progress (and doubly so for the sound engine), it currently implements all of the main features of the engine's instrument and sample system.

Please read the other text files included in this folder for information on running and using Calypso.

Features:
 -Near-total access to the SCSP's audio capabilities
 -Keyboard support for playing instruments
 -32 preset samples that can be changed by the user
 -Intuitive system for designing FM instruments
 -Sample map support
 -Instrument macro support, allowing for parameter envelopes
 -Saving and loading sound parameters

Planned Features:
 -Optimized sound code

Although Calypso implements the SCSP-DSP's features to a small extent, the particular complexities of working with it (particularly within the confines of Calypso's narrow scope) mean that a full DSP test program will likely be a separate project.
